## Prerequisites
Node version manager - [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to easily install and manage node versions

## Local Development
Simply, run `nvm use && npm i && npm run dev` and it will start a local server for you to develop on, it will also watch for changes and reload the page for you.

### Required Environment Variables
Set the following values in your `.env` file before running the dashboard:

```
VITE_HA_URL=<https://your-homeassistant>
VITE_HA_TOKEN=<long-lived token>
```

The token is optional if you only need read-only access.

## Dependencies

```json
Node.js >=18.0.0
npm >=7.0.0
```

## Building
Run `npm run build` and it will build the files for you, you can then upload them to your home assistant instance using the deploy script mentioned below.

## Deploy to Home Assistant via SSH
1. Replace the values in the .env file provided with your `VITE_SSH_USERNAME`, `VITE_SSH_HOSTNAME` and `VITE_SSH_PASSWORD`.
2. To automatically deploy to your home assistant instance, you can run `npm run deploy` after you've retrieved the SSH information specified [here](https://shannonhochkins.github.io/ha-component-kit/?path=/docs/introduction-deploying--docs), NOTE! The script has already been created for you, you just need to run it after you've updated the .env values.
3. The `VITE_FOLDER_NAME` is the folder that will be created on your home assistant instance, this is where the files will be uploaded to.

## Folder name & Vite
The `VITE_FOLDER_NAME` is the folder that will be created on your home assistant instance, this is where the files will be uploaded to. If you change the `VITE_FOLDER_NAME` variable, it will also update the `vite.config.ts` value named `base` to the same value so that when deployed using the deployment script the pathname's are correct.

## Typescript Sync

1. Replace the values in the `.env` file provided with your own if the script hasn't handled this for you already
2. The `VITE_HA_URL` should be a https url if you want to sync your types successfully.
3. The `VITE_HA_TOKEN` instructions can be found [here](https://shannonhochkins.github.io/ha-component-kit/?path=/docs/introduction-typescriptsync--docs) under the pre-requisites section.

Once you have both the above environment variables set, you can run `npm run sync` and it will create a file for you, you then just have to add it to the tsconfig.json.

### HA TOKEN
The token by default will only be used by local development and the sync-script, if you wish to have your token bundled with your project you can move the declaration in the `.env.development` file to the `.env` file, then remove the `.env.development` file as well as update the `scripts/sync-types.ts` file to remove the `.env.development` loader.

# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type-aware lint rules:

```js
export default tseslint.config({
  extends: [
    // Remove ...tseslint.configs.recommended and replace with this
    ...tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked,
    // Alternatively, use this for stricter rules
    ...tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked,
    // Optionally, add this for stylistic rules
    ...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked,
  ],
  languageOptions: {
    // other options...
    parserOptions: {
      project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
})
```

You can also install [eslint-plugin-react-x](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-x) and [eslint-plugin-react-dom](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-dom) for React-specific lint rules:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import reactX from 'eslint-plugin-react-x'
import reactDom from 'eslint-plugin-react-dom'

export default tseslint.config({
  plugins: {
    // Add the react-x and react-dom plugins
    'react-x': reactX,
    'react-dom': reactDom,
  },
  rules: {
    // other rules...
    // Enable its recommended typescript rules
    ...reactX.configs['recommended-typescript'].rules,
    ...reactDom.configs.recommended.rules,
  },
})
```
## Contributing
New cards can be added using the component registry. Wrap your component in `useRegisterComponent` with a unique id, supported types, and a display check. See `ComponentRegistry.tsx` for examples.
